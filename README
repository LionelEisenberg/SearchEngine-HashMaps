 - HashMapBench.java: bench file for the HashMap. Feel free to change the size
 - HashMapTest.java: Junit Test file for our HashMap implementation.
 - HashMapV0: "Failed" HashMap implementation that used chainning.
 - JHUgle.java: main file to run JHUgle.java.

PROBLEMS TO SIGNAL:

We do brut force the findNextPrime() method and we are sure there must be a more
efficient way of calculating the next prime, however we saw that the time it
took to resize really didnt affect our results that much.

We looked at using the Sieve or Eratosthenes but again it seemed too extra
for the scope of this project
